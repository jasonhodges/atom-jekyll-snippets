# Jekyll snippets package for the Atom editor.

Jekyll snippets for the Atom editor. This is a build from the [sublime-jekyll package](https://github.com/23maverick23/sublime-jekyll)
by [@23maverick23.](https://github.com/23maverick23) I also want to thank [Christina Solana](https://github.com/CristinaSolana) for the Atom invite and
providing some direction.

- each prefix starts with jek, for example:
  - jekfm `tab` = front-matter
  - jekcom  `tab` = comment


- currently this should work in .md, .markdown and .html files

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets. The original sublime-jekyll package has quite a bit more
to it, like code completions, that hopefully could be implemented here for Atom.
